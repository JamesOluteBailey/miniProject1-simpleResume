<h1>WestMec Lyrics</h1>
<h2>"In The End"- Linkin Park</h2>
  <p align ="center">
    It starts with
  One thing I don't know why
  It doesn’t even matter how hard you try
  Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
  To explain in due time
  All I know
  Time is a valuable thing
  Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
  Watch it count down to the end of the day
  The clock ticks life away
  It’s so unreal
  Didn’t look out below
  Watch the time go right out the window
  Trying to hold on but didn’t even know
  I wasted it all just to watch you go

  I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
  What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when...

  I tried so hard
  And got so far
  But in the end
  It doesn't even matter
  I had to fall
  To lose it all
  But in the end
  It doesn't even matter

  One thing, I don’t know why
  It doesn’t even matter how hard you try
  Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
  To remind myself how
  I tried so hard
  In spite of the way you were mocking me
  Acting like I was part of your property
  Remembering all the times you fought with me
  I’m surprised it got so (far)
  Things aren’t the way they were before
  You wouldn’t even recognize me anymore
  Not that you knew me back then
  But it all comes back to me
  In the end

  You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
  What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when...

  I tried so hard
  And got so far
  But in the end
  It doesn’t even matter
  I had to fall
  To lose it all
  But in the end
  It doesn’t even matter

  I've put my trust in you
  Pushed as far as I can go
  For all this
  There’s only one thing you should know
  I've put my trust in you
  Pushed as far as I can go
  For all this
  There’s only one thing you should know

  I tried so hard
  And got so far
  But in the end
  It doesn’t even matter
  I had to fall
  To lose it all
  But in the end
  It doesn’t even matter
